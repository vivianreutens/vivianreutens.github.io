## Summer 2025: Public Service Summer Institute Fellow

Supported **Thrive by Design** in collecting data on Black women's mental and physical health for grant applications, and in developing a targeted advertising strategy for Black women ages 28–50.

- Researched the impact of mental health challenges and common barriers to seeking help on Black women's physical health outcomes and daily functioning.
- Conducted market research on the health and wellness industry and Black women's attitudes towards it.
- Used Python and R to collect, analyze, and visualize data from Statista, NSDUH, GSS, and NHIS datasets.
    - Contextualized raw data through frameworks like the *Superwoman Schema* and the *Black–White Mental Health Paradox*.
- Created 100+ graphics segmented by age group, showing differentiated opportunities for outreach.
